### Open States Status

http://openstates-status.org is live. It does the following:
1. Allows people to claim... and importantly unclaim a state (by adding/removing your own name to/from a state in the Google Sheet)
2. Displays who's working on what state in straightforward way.
3. Enables filtering for which states haven't yet been claimed. (Unclaimed states show up in blue)
4. Displays a map of completed states
5. Links to Pull Request and GitHub accounts.
6. Enables Pull Requests on the page.
